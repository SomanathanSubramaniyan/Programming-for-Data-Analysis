    "### NumPy \n",
    "NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. It contains among other things a powerful N-dimensional array object. Besides its obvious scientific uses, NumPy can also be used as an efficient multi-dimensional container of generic data. \n",
    "### Problem statement\n",
    "1. Explain the overall purpose of the package. \n",
    "2. Explain the use of the “Simple random data” and “Permutations” functions. \n",
    "3. Explain the use and purpose of at least ﬁve “Distributions” functions. \n",
    "4. Explain the use of seeds in generating pseudorandom numbers."

    "Random Sampling is a sampling method in which all members of a group (population) have an equal and independent chance of being selected.The Numpy.random package helps generate random numbers like pick a random element from a list, pick a random card from a deck, flip a coin etc. without wrinting underneath code.\n",
